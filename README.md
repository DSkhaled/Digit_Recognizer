# Digit Recognizer
This project was carried out as part of a competition on Kaggle.com. I have implemented an image classification algorithm to predict human handwriting. For the modeling, I used a convolutional neural network (CNN) with five hidden layers and a customized optimizer in order to avoid local minima problems and push the algorithm to converge more quickly. The architecture of the algorithm briefly explained just above allowed to get a 99.2% of accuracy !!
